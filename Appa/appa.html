  <h1>Appa the Corgi</h1>
  <p>Now you may be thinking, "Appa? I thought this was supposed to be a website about Vivian, more specifically her photography page. But I'm countering with the argument that Appa is one of my main personality traits and these are all photos i've taken of him, so it fits the criteria. Besides, he clearly deserves his own page. Just look at him!</p>
  <p>Fun facts about Appa:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He's a Pembroke Welsh Corgi</li>
    <li>He's 5 years old</li>
    <li>His original name was Dusty</li>
    <li>He is named after the flying bison from Avatar: the Last Airbender</li>
    </ul>
