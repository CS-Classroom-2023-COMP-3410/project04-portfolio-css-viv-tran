Personal Portfolio Website - CSS
---

**Objective**:

Continue the development of your personal portfolio website by ensuring it is fully responsive and styled with your own creativity. You are free to use any CSS framework you prefer (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, Foundation) or to create responsiveness manually with media queriesâ€”or a mix of both. The goal is to make your site functional and visually appealing across a variety of device sizes.

---

**Prerequisites**:

- Completed the basic HTML version of your Personal Portfolio Website.

---

**Requirements**:

1. **Responsive Design**:
    - Your website must be fully responsive and functional on: 
        - **mobile (e.g., 375px wide)**
        - **tablet (e.g., 768px wide)**, and
        - **desktop (e.g., 1440px wide)** devices.
    - All content must be visible without any sideways scrolling.
    - Avoid excessive whitespace or elements that dominate the screen space unnecessarily.
    - Use browser developer tools or resizing to test your website across different screen sizes.

2. **Frameworks and Custom Styling**:
    - You are welcome to use any CSS framework that suits your design goals or to implement responsiveness manually using CSS media queries.
    - Regardless of the method, **you must include personal styling** to give your site a unique look. Examples include:
        - Customized fonts, colors, and button styles.
        - Unique hover effects or transitions.
        - Adding creative layouts, borders, or backgrounds.
    - Your custom styles must be organized in a separate CSS file.

3. **Navbar**:
    - A functional navigation bar should appear on all pages, linking to the major sections of your site.
    - The navbar should adjust appropriately for smaller screens (e.g., collapse into a hamburger menu).

4. **Old Page Updates**:
    - Update all the existing pages from your previous assignment to be fully responsive.

5. **Accessibility**:
    - Implement best practices for accessibility, including:
        - Descriptive alt text for all images.
        - Clear headings and logical page structure.
        - Appropriate contrast between text and background colors.

6. **Responsiveness Screenshots**:
    - Take screenshots of one page of your site on a mobile, tablet, and desktop view.
    - Save them as `screenshot-mobile.png`, `screenshot-tablet.png`, and `screenshot-desktop.png` (or your preferred file extension).

**Submission Instructions**:

1. Include all `.html` and `.css` files in your git repository.
2. Include the screenshots mentioned above, demonstrating responsiveness on different device sizes.
3. Write a `reflection.md` file to explain your design choices, the challenges you faced, and how you approached responsiveness.
4. Upload your final site to your CS Unix account in a new folder `public_html/responsive`. Ensure that the site is accessible via the URL `http://cs.du.edu/~yourusername/responsive`. Once your original portfolio has been graded you can replace it with this new version in the root `public_html` directory, if you'd like.

**Assessment**:

1. **Responsiveness**: Does the website adapt well to all required screen sizes without content being cut off or unnecessary scrolling?
2. **Design and Creativity**: Are your custom styles visually appealing and aligned with the theme of your portfolio?
3. **Code Quality**: Is your code organized, clean, and well-documented?
4. **Functionality**: Does the site function as intended (e.g., navigation links, responsive layouts, accessible features)?
5. **Reflection**: Have you provided thoughtful insights into your design and development process?
