  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi there! My name is Vivian Tran and I'm currently a 3rd year student at the Univeristy of Denver studying computer science and business administration. I was born and raised in Denver and in my free time I enjoy binge watching limited series, building legos, and playing with my dog. You'll hear more about my dog later though as there is a whole page on this site dedicated to him! Did you know that wombats can run up to 25 mph? It's true, they can. That's clearly not a fun fact about me but it's one I often enjoy telling people so I'm claiming it as my own. </p>
  <p>Along with legos and wombats, I'm also interested in photography which is what this site is focused on.</p>

  <p>Most of the photos I've included in my gallery are from my semester studying abroad, so below is a table of my personal ratings for the cities I visted.</p>
