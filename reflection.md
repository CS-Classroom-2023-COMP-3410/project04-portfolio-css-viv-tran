I think the hardest part of this assignment was just making creative decisions. I looked at templates for inspiration, but was pretty much unable to decipher the code, most of them has increidbly long CSS files that contained a lot of things I was unfamiliar with. However, starting from scratch is difficult because it forces you to decide on an innumerable amount of details if you're trying to achieve a very specific look. For me, it was difficult to even think what kind of look I was going for, so instead I started with smaller elements and made a bunch of small, separate prompts to chatGPT such as make a black box, how can i round the corners, how can i make it transparent, etc. It wasn't the most efficient but it allowed me to think through the process and make small adjustments and see how tweaking little things in the code makes a huge visual difference
